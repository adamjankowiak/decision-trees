# Decision Trees with Cost-Complexity Pruning

This repository demonstrates the use of **decision trees with cost-complexity pruning** in Python using scikit-learn. The project focuses on **attribute-based classification**, with the goal of identifying which features are most predictive of a target class.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project was originally developed using real-world clinical data, which cannot be shared publicly due to privacy concerns.
> For demonstration purposes, a synthetic dataset (`example_data_structure.csv`) is provided. It mimics the structure of the real dataset, but all values are randomly generated.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal of the project is **classification based on input attributes**.  
Using decision trees, the analysis attempts to identify patterns and thresholds in the data that allow assigning observations to specific classes.  
Cost-complexity pruning is used to reduce model complexity and improve generalization by removing less informative splits.

## 🔐 Data Privacy

This repository contains no real data or confidential results.
Only randomized, structurally accurate sample data is included for demonstration purposes.
